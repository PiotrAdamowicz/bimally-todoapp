# Basic Todo App

Simple todo app made for recruitment in BimAlly

## Summary

I've discovered that you can make Todo App infinitly complex and work on every tiny detail so given time limitation (3days), which were reasonable for recruitment task, I've set some simple minimum goals and tied to follow them. You can see those goals in previous versions of this file.

Basic project was run from [Vite + MUI + Ts Template](https://github.com/emre-cil/vite-mui-ts)

##### What went good:

- I have working simple todo App.
- You can add, remove and edit tasks.
- It generates first input date for every task.
- Simple validation for empty inputs.
- Looks decently.

##### What could go better:

- UI could be better.
- RWD could be better but I'm no Graphic designer.
- Better familiarity with MUI would be nice.
- Better Component separation.
- Naming conventions for variables could be more consistent.
- Arrangement of components
- Test for functions like date parsing
